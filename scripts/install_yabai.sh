$(which yabai) is not signed, and there is no self signed certificate.

Yabai needs to be signed to avoid having the Accessability popup every couple of seconds. Follow these instructions:

First, open Keychain Access.app. In its menu, navigate to Keychain Access, then Certificate Assistance, then click Create a Certificate.... This will open the Certificate Assistant. Choose these options:

Name: yabai-cert
Identity Type: Self-Signed Root
Certificate Type: Code Signing
Click Create, then Continue to create the certificate.
